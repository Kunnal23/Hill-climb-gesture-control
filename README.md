Hill Climb Racing - Gesture Control 🚗✋

Control Hill Climb Racing using simple hand gestures with computer vision. 
This project uses only two gestures — a fist and an open hand — to drive the car in the game, creating an intuitive and fun experience.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python
OpenCV (for real-time hand tracking)
MediaPipe (for hand pose estimation)
Pynput (for simulating keyboard inputs)

🎮 How It Works

Fist Gesture → Brake/Stop the car
Open Hand Gesture → Accelerate the car
